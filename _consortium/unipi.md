**Alina Sîrbu** is Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Pisa, Italy. Her research is on complex systems modelling, data science and machine learning, applied to biomedical, social and technical systems. She obtained her PhD in 2011 from Dublin City University, Ireland, with a thesis in Computational Biology. Afterwards, she held postdoctoral research positions at the Institute for Scientific Interchange in Turin (Italy) and at the University of Bologna (Italy). She was Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at New York University Shanghai (2014) and New York University Abu Dhabi (2017). She has been involved in several interdisciplinary National and  European projects, and is currently national coordinator of the MEDICA PRIN 2022  project (2023-2025), and local coordinator of the HumMingBird H2020 European project (2019-2023)  and of the ALMONDO PRIN 2022 PNRR project (2023-2025).

**Valentina Pansanella** was born in 1995 in Perugia, Italy.  She is currently a researcher at ISTI-CNR, Pisa, on the SoBigData.it project, with a past position at UNIPI in the ALMONDO project.  In January 2024, she got her PhD in Data Science at Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa (Italy) with a thesis on social networking platforms' dynamics and the definition of models and analytical methods to study opinion diffusion. Currently, her main research concerns the study and development of opinion diffusion models and, more broadly, on the societal impact of social and mass media.
