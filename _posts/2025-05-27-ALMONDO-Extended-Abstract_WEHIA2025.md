# 📢 Two extended abstracts accepted at WEHIA 2025 Conference 🎉
The special session, titled ***“Climate Lobbying and Dynamics of Opinions”***, will focus on the insights that the **agent-based models** can highlight about the **lobbying around topics related to climate change**. The session will feature two contributions from the ALMONDO research community and another from external collaborators.

## 🛠 First extended Abstract Title 
**“A survey experiment on Climate Change Beliefs”**

In this work our research fellow of the SSSA unit, Leonardo Ciambezi, will show the **results of the survey experiment about social media influence on climate change belief**, conducted within our ALMONDO project. 

## 🛠 Second extended Abstract Title 
**“Navigating the Climate Lobbying Landscape: Insights from Opinion Dynamics”**

A second work will be presented by our Lecturer in Business Analytics & Innovation Lilit Popoyan. In this work, we develop an **agent-based model for opinion dynamics to study the interplay between lobbying strategies, public belief formation**, and the resulting policy implications.
