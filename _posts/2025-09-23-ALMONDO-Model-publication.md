**Almondo Model Code 💻** - Our opinion dynamics mathematical model of climate lobbying is now publicly available!🚀 You can find it in the GitHub repository of the project! 


AlmondoModel is a diffusion model designed to simulate the diffusion of influence across a network with the influence of lobbyists having different strategies. It extends the `DiffusionModel` class from the `ndlib` library, enabling the simulation of opinion evolution and the effects of lobbying activities over time. The model can be customized with various parameters such as probabilities for optimistic and pessimistic events, node influence factors, and more.

The Model is available in the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ALMONDO-Project/ALMONDO-Model](https://github.com/ALMONDO-Project/ALMONDO-Model)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ALMONDO-Project/ALMONDO-Model.git
