🚀 Last week, our ALMONDO research team had the pleasure of **participating in the Society 5.0 Conference** in beautiful *San Benedetto Del Tronto*, hosted by the **University of Camerino**!👏

---

💡 We had the opportunity to facilitate the workshop: *"Opinion Formation, Influence and Diffusion in the Era of Social Media: The Case of Climate Change"* led by **Daniele Giachini**, **Leonardo Ciambezi**, **Alina Sirbu**, and **Verdiana Del Rosso**. 🙏A special thank you to the facilitators for co-leading the session with passion, to **Valentina Pansanella** for her contribution in the work, and **Fabrizio Fornari** for his huge effort in the organization.

🔍  The workshop explored how *social media dynamics and lobbying tactics influence public perception of climate change*, drawing from our ongoing **ALMONDO PNRR 2022 PRIN project**. We shared ideas on how information spreads, how opinions form, and how digital environments shape climate narratives. 🌍

🍽️We ended the day with a fantastic seaside gala dinner 🐟🦑 — a perfect chance to connect and network.

🙏 Thanks to the **[Society 5.0 Conference](https://www.conference-society5.org/) organizers** and to all participants who joined our session!
