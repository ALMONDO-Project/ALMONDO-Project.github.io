🎓 On 26 January 2026, the ALMONDO research team will host its Final Workshop at the University of Naples “Parthenope”, marking the conclusion of the ALMONDO PNRR 2022 PRIN project. The event will bring together researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to discuss the role of data, opinion dynamics, and lobbying in shaping climate-related beliefs and policies. 🌍

💡 The workshop will open with a keynote address by Antoine Mandel (University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne) on “A Hypergraph Analysis of the European Commission Lobby Network”, followed by two thematic sessions presenting core ALMONDO research results and invited contributions at the intersection of opinion dynamics, climate economics, and computational social science.

Throughout the day, ALMONDO researchers will present findings on climate lobbying strategies, survey experiments on climate beliefs, opinion dynamics modelling, and the ALMONDO user interface, offering a comprehensive overview of the project’s scientific outcomes.

The afternoon will feature a Policy Panel with experts from academia and civil society, fostering dialogue on the implications of climate lobbying and influence networks for evidence-based policymaking.

We warmly thank all speakers, chairs, and members of the Organizing Committee—Pasquale Marcello Falcone, Lilit Popoyan, Daniele Giachini, Alina Sîrbu, and Fabrizio Fornari—as well as all participants who will join us in Naples or online.

📍 Venue: University of Naples “Parthenope”, Palazzo Pacanowski

💻 Online participation: available via Webex

We look forward to closing the ALMONDO project with a rich and engaging exchange of ideas!
