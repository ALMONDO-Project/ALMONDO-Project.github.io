<h1 id="-report-description">📃 Report Description</h1>

<p>This report presents the findings of a survey experiment conducted as part of the ALMONDO project to explore how social media content influences public beliefs and engagement with climate change issues. Participants were exposed to three types of information treatments derived from real-life social media posts: pro-climate content from the IPCC, dismissive content from the CO2 Coalition, and unrelated content as an active control. The goal is to evaluate how these treatments affect posterior beliefs and the respondents’ willingness to engage in climate-related actions, such as signing petitions or donating to causes. The report outlines the experimental protocol, survey structure, and preliminary results from a pilot study, highlighting the dynamics of climate-related opinions and the varying impacts of information provision on individual beliefs.</p>

<p>While many studies find significant effects of information provision on beliefs about climate change, the influence on policy support and commitment to climate action appears weaker. The report emphasizes the importance of understanding how different types of information can shape public engagement with climate issues, guiding effective communication strategies for climate action. Preliminary findings from the pilot study suggest a general awareness of climate change among respondents, but a notable disconnect between beliefs about climate change and support for related policies. Future work aims to expand the sample size and further analyse the effects of social media exposure on climate beliefs and behaviours.</p>

<h1 id="-report-description">📃 Report Description</h1>

<p>The report on model development focuses on the dynamics of climate lobbying and human behavioral biases, which are crucial for influencing policies and public attitudes toward climate change. It highlights the evolution of climate lobbying from grassroots efforts to a complex arena involving various actors, such as environmental NGOs and corporate interests. The integration of lobbying dynamics into opinion dynamics models is emphasized as an underexplored area. The ALMONDO project aims to bridge this gap by developing a model that accounts for behavioral biases and strategic lobbying, providing insights into how public perception and policy decisions are shaped through lobbying strategies.</p>

<p>The report outlines three key tasks in the modeling effort: a literature review identifying relevant behavioral biases, the development of a mathematical model for opinion dynamics, and an analysis of the model’s properties. The behavioral biases involved include simplification, availability, and herding, which influence how agents process information. The model incorporates lobbyists as external agents who aim to sway public beliefs through strategic signaling while operating under budget constraints. Theoretical exercises explore scenarios involving one or two lobbyists and their strategic interactions, while numerical simulations assess the model’s dynamics in various contexts. Overall, the report provides an overview of how opinion dynamics evolve under the influence of behavioral biases and lobbying activities.</p>

<h1 id="-report-description">📃 Report Description</h1>

<p>The report file contains a detailed report on data analysis related to climate lobbying and the public debate on climate issues. 
It describes the objectives of the ALMONDO project and the data collection process, utilizing sources such as the EU Transparency Register, Lobby Map, EU public consultations, and LobbyFacts. The report analyzes the lobbying activities of various organizations, including lobbying budgets and targeted policies, with descriptive statistics on lobbying budgets and the influence of organizations.</p>

<p>Additionally, it presents an analysis of posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit related to the climate debate, highlighting communication patterns and engagement strategies. Finally, the report summarizes lobbying activities and public opinions on climate, providing a comprehensive overview of the climate lobbying landscape and public opinion dynamics.</p>
