<p>🔎 <strong>What we studied</strong>:</p>

<p>Using firm-level data (LobbyFacts + ORBIS, 2011–2023) and a mix of AI-assisted textual analysis and econometrics, we map who lobbies on climate in Italy, how much they spend, and what drives participation in EU climate policy meetings.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>Take-home messages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Revenue is the #1 driver</em></strong>: higher-revenue firms spend more on lobbying and show up more in climate-related meetings—especially very large companies.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Regional divide matters</em></strong>: lobbying is concentrated in the North (Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Lazio), mirroring Italy’s industrial geography.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Who’s at the table?</em></strong> Capital-intensive, highly regulated sectors (e.g., energy, manufacturing, professional services) account for the largest outlays; SMEs are present but under-represented (though growing since 2017).</li>
  <li><strong><em>Policy milestones, policy attention</em></strong>: engagement spiked around major EU initiatives (Paris Agreement, Green Deal, Fit for 55).</li>
  <li><strong><em>Why it matters</em></strong>: when only the biggest voices are heard, the risk of asymmetric influence grows—making transparency and broader participation essential.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="-abstract-of-the-article">📃 Abstract of the article</h1>

<p>This study investigates the determinants of corporate climate-related lobbying in Italy, focusing on firm-level factors that influence lobbying expenditures and participation in European climate policy discussions. Given rising pressure from governments and stakeholders for sustainable practices, corporate lobbying plays a crucial role in shaping European climate policies. Using an unbalanced panel dataset of Italian firms from 2011 to 2023, we employ advanced econometric methods and AI-supported textual analysis to explore lobbying dynamics. The findings indicate that firm revenue is a key driver of lobbying intensity, with larger firms investing more in lobbying activities and engaging more frequently in climate-related discussions. Additionally, regional differences and company size significantly affect lobbying behaviors, highlighting the role of financial resources and institutional context in shaping firms’ climate policy engagement. In this, the research contributes to the limited EU-focused literature on corporate lobbying, providing valuable insights into Italy’s unique lobbying landscape and its implications for climate governance.</p>

<h1 id="-abstract-of-the-article">📃 Abstract of the article</h1>

<p>While lobbying has been demonstrated to have an important effect on public opinion and policy making, existing models of opinion formation do not specifically include its effect. In this work we introduce a new model of opinion dynamics where lobbyists can implement complex strategies and are characterised by a finite budget. Individuals update their opinions through a learning process resembling Bayesian learning, but influenced by cognitive biases such as under-reaction and confirmation bias. We study the model numerically and demonstrate rich dynamics both with and without lobbyists. In the presence of lobbying, we observe two regimes: one in which lobbyists can have full influence on the agent network, and another where the peer-effect generates polarisation. When symmetric lobbyists are present, the lobbyist influence regime is characterised by long opinion oscillations, while in the transition area between the two regimes we observe convergence to the optimistic model when the lobbying influence is long enough. These rich dynamics pave the way for studying real lobbying strategies to validate the model in practice.</p>

<p>💡 We had the opportunity to facilitate the workshop: <em>“Opinion Formation, Influence and Diffusion in the Era of Social Media: The Case of Climate Change”</em> led by <strong>Daniele Giachini</strong>, <strong>Leonardo Ciambezi</strong>, <strong>Alina Sirbu</strong>, and <strong>Verdiana Del Rosso</strong>. 🙏A special thank you to the facilitators for co-leading the session with passion, to <strong>Valentina Pansanella</strong> for her contribution in the work, and <strong>Fabrizio Fornari</strong> for his huge effort in the organization.</p>

<p>🔍  The workshop explored how <em>social media dynamics and lobbying tactics influence public perception of climate change</em>, drawing from our ongoing <strong>ALMONDO PNRR 2022 PRIN project</strong>. We shared ideas on how information spreads, how opinions form, and how digital environments shape climate narratives. 🌍</p>

<h1 id="-report-description">📃 Report Description</h1>

<p>The report on model development focuses on the dynamics of climate lobbying and human behavioral biases, which are crucial for influencing policies and public attitudes toward climate change. It highlights the evolution of climate lobbying from grassroots efforts to a complex arena involving various actors, such as environmental NGOs and corporate interests. The integration of lobbying dynamics into opinion dynamics models is emphasized as an underexplored area. The ALMONDO project aims to bridge this gap by developing a model that accounts for behavioral biases and strategic lobbying, providing insights into how public perception and policy decisions are shaped through lobbying strategies.</p>

<p>The report outlines three key tasks in the modeling effort: a literature review identifying relevant behavioral biases, the development of a mathematical model for opinion dynamics, and an analysis of the model’s properties. The behavioral biases involved include simplification, availability, and herding, which influence how agents process information. The model incorporates lobbyists as external agents who aim to sway public beliefs through strategic signaling while operating under budget constraints. Theoretical exercises explore scenarios involving one or two lobbyists and their strategic interactions, while numerical simulations assess the model’s dynamics in various contexts. Overall, the report provides an overview of how opinion dynamics evolve under the influence of behavioral biases and lobbying activities.</p>
