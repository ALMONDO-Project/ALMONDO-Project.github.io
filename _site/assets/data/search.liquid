In this work we introduce a new model of opinion dynamics where lobbyists can implement complex strategies and are characterised by a finite budget. Individuals update their opinions through a learning process resembling Bayesian learning, but influenced by cognitive biases such as under-reaction and confirmation bias. We study the model numerically and demonstrate rich dynamics both with and without lobbyists. In the presence of lobbying, we observe two regimes: one in which lobbyists can have full influence on the agent network, and another where the peer-effect generates polarisation. When symmetric lobbyists are present, the lobbyist influence regime is characterised by long opinion oscillations, while in the transition area between the two regimes we observe convergence to the optimistic model when the lobbying influence is long enough. These rich dynamics pave the way for studying real lobbying strategies to validate the model in practice.For more informations on the ArXiv preprint version click on the following link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13767Download preprint article 📃" }, { "title" : "Workshop at Society 5.0 Conference 2025", "category" : "", "tags" : " Page", "url" : "/news/2025/07/01/ALMONDO-Conference-Society50.html", "date" : "July 1, 2025", "excerpt" : "🚀 Last week, our ALMONDO research team had the pleasure of participating in the Society 5.0 Conference in beautiful San Benedetto Del Tronto, hosted by the University of Camerino!👏💡 We had the opportunity to facilitate the workshop: “Opinion Forma...", "content" : "🚀 Last week, our ALMONDO research team had the pleasure of participating in the Society 5.0 Conference in beautiful San Benedetto Del Tronto, hosted by the University of Camerino!👏💡 We had the opportunity to facilitate the workshop: “Opinion Formation, Influence and Diffusion in the Era of Social Media: The Case of Climate Change” led by Daniele Giachini, Leonardo Ciambezi, Alina Sirbu, and Verdiana Del Rosso. 🙏A special thank you to the facilitators for co-leading the session with passion, to Valentina Pansanella for her contribution in the work, and Fabrizio Fornari for his huge effort in the organization.🔍 The workshop explored how social media dynamics and lobbying tactics influence public perception of climate change, drawing from our ongoing ALMONDO PNRR 2022 PRIN project.

Participants were exposed to three types of information treatments derived from real-life social media posts: pro-climate content from the IPCC, dismissive content from the CO2 Coalition, and unrelated content as an active control. The goal is to evaluate how these treatments affect posterior beliefs and the respondents’ willingness to engage in climate-related actions, such as signing petitions or donating to causes. The report outlines the experimental protocol, survey structure, and preliminary results from a pilot study, highlighting the dynamics of climate-related opinions and the varying impacts of information provision on individual beliefs.While many studies find significant effects of information provision on beliefs about climate change, the influence on policy support and commitment to climate action appears weaker. The report emphasizes the importance of understanding how different types of information can shape public engagement with climate issues, guiding effective communication strategies for climate action. Preliminary findings from the pilot study suggest a general awareness of climate change among respondents, but a notable disconnect between beliefs about climate change and support for related policies. Future work aims to expand the sample size and further analyse the effects of social media exposure on climate beliefs and behaviours.Download Report 📃" }, { "title" : "Report on Climate Lobbying Model", "category" : "", "tags" : " Page", "url" : "/publications/2024/11/29/ALMONDO-Model-Report.html", "date" : "November 29, 2024", "excerpt" : "Project Milestone 2 📃 - The Report on Opinions Dynamics Model for Climate Change Lobbying is now available to be downloaded.📃 Report DescriptionThe report on model development focuses on the dynamics of climate lobbying and human behavioral biases...", "content" : "Project Milestone 2 📃 - The Report on Opinions Dynamics Model for Climate Change Lobbying is now available to be downloaded.📃 Report DescriptionThe report on model development focuses on the dynamics of climate lobbying and human behavioral biases, which are crucial for influencing policies and public attitudes toward climate change. It highlights the evolution of climate lobbying from grassroots efforts to a complex arena involving various actors, such as environmental NGOs and corporate interests. The integration of lobbying dynamics into opinion dynamics models is emphasized as an underexplored area. The ALMONDO project aims to bridge this gap by developing a model that accounts for behavioral biases and strategic lobbying, providing insights into how public perception and policy decisions are shaped through lobbying strategies.The report outlines three key tasks in the modeling effort: a literature review identifying relevant behavioral biases, the development of a mathematical model for opinion dynamics, and an analysis of the model’s properties. The behavioral biases involved include simplification, availability, and herding, which influence how agents process information. The model incorporates lobbyists as external agents who aim to sway public beliefs through strategic signaling while operating under budget constraints. Theoretical exercises explore scenarios involving one or two lobbyists and their strategic interactions, while numerical simulations assess the model’s dynamics in various contexts. Overall, the report provides an overview of how opinion dynamics evolve under the influence of behavioral biases and lobbying activities.Download Report 📃" }, { "title" : "Report on Climate Lobbying and Opinions", "category" : "", "tags" : " Page", "url" : "/publications/2024/05/31/ALMONDO-Report.html", "date" : "May 31, 2024", "excerpt" : "Project Milestone 1 📃 - The Report on Climate Lobbying and Opinions is now available to be downloaded.📃 Report DescriptionThe report file contains a detailed report on data analysis related to climate lobbying and the public debate on climate issu...", "content" : "Project Milestone 1 📃 - The Report on Climate Lobbying and Opinions is now available to be downloaded.📃 Report DescriptionThe report file contains a detailed report on data analysis related to climate lobbying and the public debate on climate issues.
