Participants were exposed to three types of information treatments derived from real-life social media posts: pro-climate content from the IPCC, dismissive content from the CO2 Coalition, and unrelated content as an active control. The goal is to evaluate how these treatments affect posterior beliefs and the respondents’ willingness to engage in climate-related actions, such as signing petitions or donating to causes. The report outlines the experimental protocol, survey structure, and preliminary results from a pilot study, highlighting the dynamics of climate-related opinions and the varying impacts of information provision on individual beliefs.While many studies find significant effects of information provision on beliefs about climate change, the influence on policy support and commitment to climate action appears weaker. The report emphasizes the importance of understanding how different types of information can shape public engagement with climate issues, guiding effective communication strategies for climate action. Preliminary findings from the pilot study suggest a general awareness of climate change among respondents, but a notable disconnect between beliefs about climate change and support for related policies. Future work aims to expand the sample size and further analyse the effects of social media exposure on climate beliefs and behaviours.Download Report 📃" }, { "title" : "Report on Climate Lobbying Model", "category" : "", "tags" : " Page", "url" : "/publications/2024/11/29/ALMONDO-Model-Report.html", "date" : "November 29, 2024", "excerpt" : "Project Milestone 2 📃 - The Report on Opinions Dynamics Model for Climate Change Lobbying is now available to be downloaded.📃 Report DescriptionThe report on model development focuses on the dynamics of climate lobbying and human behavioral biases...", "content" : "Project Milestone 2 📃 - The Report on Opinions Dynamics Model for Climate Change Lobbying is now available to be downloaded.📃 Report DescriptionThe report on model development focuses on the dynamics of climate lobbying and human behavioral biases, which are crucial for influencing policies and public attitudes toward climate change. It highlights the evolution of climate lobbying from grassroots efforts to a complex arena involving various actors, such as environmental NGOs and corporate interests. The integration of lobbying dynamics into opinion dynamics models is emphasized as an underexplored area. The ALMONDO project aims to bridge this gap by developing a model that accounts for behavioral biases and strategic lobbying, providing insights into how public perception and policy decisions are shaped through lobbying strategies.The report outlines three key tasks in the modeling effort: a literature review identifying relevant behavioral biases, the development of a mathematical model for opinion dynamics, and an analysis of the model’s properties. The behavioral biases involved include simplification, availability, and herding, which influence how agents process information. The model incorporates lobbyists as external agents who aim to sway public beliefs through strategic signaling while operating under budget constraints. Theoretical exercises explore scenarios involving one or two lobbyists and their strategic interactions, while numerical simulations assess the model’s dynamics in various contexts. Overall, the report provides an overview of how opinion dynamics evolve under the influence of behavioral biases and lobbying activities.Download Report 📃" }, { "title" : "Report on Climate Lobbying and Opinions", "category" : "", "tags" : " Page", "url" : "/publications/2024/05/31/ALMONDO-Report.html", "date" : "May 31, 2024", "excerpt" : "Project Milestone 1 📃 - The Report on Climate Lobbying and Opinions is now available to be downloaded.📃 Report DescriptionThe report file contains a detailed report on data analysis related to climate lobbying and the public debate on climate issu...", "content" : "Project Milestone 1 📃 - The Report on Climate Lobbying and Opinions is now available to be downloaded.📃 Report DescriptionThe report file contains a detailed report on data analysis related to climate lobbying and the public debate on climate issues.

Hence, understanding how climate-related opinions dynamically change and which are the best strategies to spread climate-related scientific information in our complex and interconnected society becomes crucial.Blending knowledge from economics and computer science, our modeling approach incorporates opinion dynamics models with explicit consideration of behavioral biases for a realistic perspective.Our modeling approach starts with opinion dynamics models, modified to explicitly include behavioral biases in climate-related interactions for a more realistic perspective.To address challenges in linking models and data, we employ systematic data mining, econometric studies, and laboratory experiments. Our data collection spans various climate lobbying actors, from policymakers to citizens. Advanced econometric and data science techniques are applied for thorough analysis.Once calibrated, our model will shed light on lobbying dynamics and opinions, offering recommendations through a user-friendly website offering recommendations for environmental consensus and sustainable development." },    { "title" : "Tags", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/tags/", "date" : "N/A", "excerpt" : "", "content" : "" },   { } , { "title" : "Collaborators", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/consortium/external", "date" : "March 17, 2025", "excerpt" : "Giulio Rossetti is a Senior Researcher at the Italian National Research Council (CNR-ISTI) and an external professor at the Computer Science dept. of the University of Pisa.
